</div>

## Summary

The scope of the test is to generate the expected output files (in the `outputs` folder) given the input files (in the `inputs` folder).

The application should:
1. Display the min, max, median and average for a data set.
2. Discover under-performing periods of download performance.

If you do submit it without doing everything you'd like to do, then add a TODO file in root with the changes
you'd like to make and document any assumptions made during the implementation.

## Data
In the data provided, `dtime` represents the date of the measurement and `metricValue` represents 
the measurement in bytes per second.

## What we're looking for

We would like you to write a small application in one of the following languages/frameworks:
- PHP (Symfony 4+)
- Java (Spring)
- Go

The application should:

- Be well-structured.
- Be covered by automated tests.
- Include clear and concise commit messages.
- Include relevant documentation and/or comments.


## When you're finished

Either share your repo or send over your code in a compressed format.


Thank you and good luck!
